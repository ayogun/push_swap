# 42-Libft_Final

If you are checking my codes and want to use; please test it first. Because in my project I left some files unprotected. Since Moulinette doesn't check whether it is protected or not, I was able to pass. Nevertheless, it is good to know that some of my codes are unprotected and are needed to be fixed.
